Classification des images satellitaires avec les CNNs

Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying satellite images. Satellite imagery has become increasingly valuable in various fields including agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. The ability to automatically classify these images can provide valuable insights and aid in decision-making processes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project (Eurosat) consists of satellite images along with corresponding ground truth labels. Due to the nature of satellite imagery, the dataset might vary based on the specific application. Ensure that your dataset is properly organized and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Architecture
The convolutional neural network architecture used in this project is designed to effectively extract features from satellite images and classify them into predefined categories. The architecture may vary based on the complexity of the classification task and the available computational resources.

Training
The training process involves feeding the satellite images into the CNN model and adjusting the model parameters to minimize the classification error. It is recommended to experiment with different hyperparameters and optimization techniques to achieve optimal performance.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using a separate set of test images to assess its performance and generalization ability. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The results of the satellite image classification model will be presented in terms of performance metrics and visualizations. These results can provide insights into the effectiveness of the model and its potential applications.
